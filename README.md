# Delta Airlines Operational Delay and Cancellation Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Delta Airlinesâ€™ December 2019 flight performance to identify patterns in delays and cancellations.  
It was completed as part of an Operations Management course and demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and recommendation skills using Tableau and Excel.  

## Key Insights
- **Day-of-Week Patterns:** Sunday through Tuesday had the highest cancellation rates; Thursday through Saturday had the lowest.  
- **Geographic Trends:** Northern states (e.g., North Dakota, Alaska) experienced higher cancellation rates due to winter weather, while southern states saw fewer disruptions.  
- **Delay Drivers:** Carrier delays and late aircraft accounted for most operational lost time, particularly for Delta.  
- **Recommendations:**  
  - Build a **route-level delay probability model** combining historical and weather data.  
  - Create a **geographic risk index** for cancellations to improve resource allocation.  
  - Implement **real-time turnaround monitoring** to reduce carrier-driven delays.
